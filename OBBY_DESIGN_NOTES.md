# Obby Design - Jump Distance Calculations

## Default Roblox Character Capabilities:
- **WalkSpeed**: 16 studs/second
- **JumpPower**: 50
- **Horizontal Jump Distance**: ~10-12 studs (with running start)
- **Vertical Jump Height**: ~7-8 studs

## Current Course Design:

### Stage 1 (Spawn):
- Large 20x20 spawn platform
- No jumps required

### Stage 2 (Easy Warm-up):
- Gap distance: ~11 studs between platforms
- Platform size: 14x14 studs
- All jumps: EASY ✅

### Stage 3 (Side-to-side):
- Horizontal gap: ~7 studs to the side
- Forward gap: ~11 studs
- Diagonal distance: ~13 studs (manageable with running start)
- Platform size: 12x12 studs
- All jumps: POSSIBLE ✅

### Stage 4 (Climbing):
- Gap distance: ~11 studs forward
- Height increase: +2 studs per platform (gradual)
- Platform size: 12x12 studs
- All jumps: POSSIBLE ✅

### Stage 5 (Tricky):
- Gap distance: ~11 studs
- Diagonal jumps: ~6 studs side + ~11 studs forward = ~12.5 studs diagonal
- Platform size: 10x10 studs
- All jumps: CHALLENGING but POSSIBLE ✅

### Stage 6 (Victory Lap):
- Gap distance: ~11 studs
- Platform size: 12x12 studs
- Final jump to win: ~14 studs to large 20x20 platform
- All jumps: POSSIBLE ✅

## Jump Difficulty Progression:
1. **Stage 2**: Very Easy (straight jumps, large platforms)
2. **Stage 3**: Easy-Medium (side-to-side introduces diagonal movement)
3. **Stage 4**: Medium (adds vertical climbing)
4. **Stage 5**: Medium-Hard (smaller platforms, precise landing)
5. **Stage 6**: Easy (victory lap with easier jumps)

## Maximum Gap Distances Used:
- **Straight forward**: 11 studs (safe, easily makeable)
- **Diagonal**: 12.5 studs (requires running start, but definitely possible)
- **Platform sizes**: 10x10 minimum (good landing area)

All jumps are **100% possible** with default character stats!
